# Frontend Changes - Calculator Feature

## Overview
Added a small calculator component to the Interactive Data Dashboard, positioned in the top right of the white container at the same level as the title.

## Files Added

### 1. `/src/components/ui/Calculator.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main calculator component with full arithmetic functionality
- **Features**:
  - Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), division (÷)
  - Clear functionality (C button)
  - Decimal point support
  - Proper calculation state management
  - Responsive button grid layout (4×4 with some buttons spanning multiple cells)

### 2. `/src/styles/Calculator.module.css`
- **Purpose**: Styling for the calculator component
- **Design Features**:
  - Modern, clean design matching the app's aesthetic
  - White background with rounded corners (12px radius)
  - Hover effects with subtle transform and shadow changes
  - Grid layout for buttons (4 columns)
  - Color-coded buttons:
    - Numbers: Light gray background (#f8f9fa)
    - Operations: Blue gradient (matches app theme)
    - Equals: Green gradient
    - Clear: Red/orange gradient
  - Dark theme support with appropriate color adjustments
  - Responsive button sizing with minimum 44px height for accessibility

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/App.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for Calculator component
  - Wrapped the title in a new header div structure
  - Added Calculator component alongside the title in the header

### 2. `/src/styles/App.module.css`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `.header` class with flexbox layout
    - `justify-content: space-between` to position title left and calculator right
    - `align-items: flex-start` for proper vertical alignment
    - 20px gap between elements
  - Modified `.title` class:
    - Removed `text-align: center` and `margin-bottom`
    - Added `flex: 1` to take available space
    - Set `margin: 0`
  - Added responsive design for mobile screens (max-width: 768px):
    - Header switches to column layout
    - Elements centered
    - Title font size reduced to 2em

## Design Decisions

1. **Position**: Calculator is positioned in the top right of the white container at the same level as the "Interactive Data Dashboard" title, as requested.

2. **Size**: Compact 220px width to not overwhelm the interface while remaining fully functional.

3. **Styling**: Matches the existing modern design language with:
   - Similar border radius (12px vs 15px for main container)
   - Same shadow style (`0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`)
   - Hover effects consistent with other interactive elements
   - Color scheme aligned with the app's gradient theme

4. **Responsiveness**: On mobile devices, the calculator moves below the title in a centered layout to maintain usability.

5. **Functionality**: Full calculator functionality including:
   - All basic arithmetic operations
   - Proper calculation chaining
   - Clear button for resetting
   - Decimal point support
   - Visual feedback for button interactions
